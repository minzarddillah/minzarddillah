I have over 2 years of experience working in programming. Currently, I work as the Front-End Developer at Jagoapa (PT. Jadi Jago Mengudara), where I create a learning app then publish it to playstore and create an admin dashboard website.

When my nose isn't pressed up against a screen, you can find me cycling, eating pastries, or planning future trips to the ever-growing number of places I want to travel to someday.

I also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minzarddillah/).
